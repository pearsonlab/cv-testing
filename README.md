# cv-testing
Testing opencv-python for use with pupillometry studies

Purpose: Develop/test a technique for finding screen coordinates in an image.  This will be used for analysis of eye tracking glasses data.  By finding the coordinates of the screen corners, it will be possible to track eye movements in terms of screen coordinates rather than than the glasses' camera coordinates.

Dependencies:
* OpenCV
* Numpy
* FFmpeg encoder (for encoding video)
